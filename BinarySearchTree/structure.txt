About
-------
As this is my first attempt at using inheritence for abstraction and
code reuse on a semi-large scale, the inheritance structure has been a
little rough. I hope I won't run out of time to build all of these
implemetations.

Current
--------
BinarySearchTree - Node     
	\
	 \
      AbstractBalanceableTree - BalNode
		/
	       /
	  AVLTree

Probable
----------

	AbstractBinarySearchTree - Node
		/          \
	       /            \
    	      BST   	  AbstractBalanceableTree - BalNode
				/       \
			       /         \
			  AVLTree       RBTree

Details
--------
AbstractBinarySearchTree
  -implements get methods, conversion methods, and the Node class
BST
  -implements insert(), remove()

BalanceableAbstractTree
  -implements rotate, restructure, and BalNode

AVLTree
  -implements an AVL tree
RBTree
  -implements a Red-black tree
